# Functions use sample
This is a sample showing how a function can be used to reuse a piece of code.

_**NOTE: It's just for educational purpose, not a real world application and it doesn't necessary follow all the best development praticies**_

### Running
 - Clone this repository `git clone git@github.com:programadorsemfronteira/functions_use_sample.git`; 
 - Run `npm install` installing dependencies;
 - Run `npm run test` verifying the current implementation is working.

 The current implementation uses a function called `hasAccess` shared between modules.

 An implementation without using this function is available as well on [a previous commit](https://github.com/programadorsemfronteira/functions_use_sample/commit/b24115b66f291250dc13b1ebdf0a89f131902f1b).

 ### Checking out the implementation using the code duplicated on both modules 

- Verify the different commit running `git checkout b24115b66f291250dc13b1ebdf0a89f131902f1b`
- Run `npm run test` verifying the implementation is still working.

_NOTE: Once you have done, run `git switch -` switching back to the `main` implementation._
